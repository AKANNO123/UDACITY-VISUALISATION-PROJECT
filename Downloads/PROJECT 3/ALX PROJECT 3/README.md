The Loan Data from Prosper, is a data set with 113937 loans with 81 variables, whcich include loan amount, borrower rate, current loan status, borrower income etc.


## Summary of Findings

> The completed loan repayment status is much higher than the non-remittance loan with about 13,000 counts. Debt consolidation is the highest among the listing category with a very wide margin.The least of the loan repayment occupation can be identified as student technical school. In addition, the number of employed persons were more based on the employment status. The income range distribution shows that the income between 25,000 to 49,999 dollars has the highest count while approximately zero dollar income was the least of the income range.

> There is a high relationship bwteeen the employed and the completed loan status, which is observed to be the highest compared to other employment status. Moreso the employed has the highest correlation with the non-remittance loan status. This is followed by the full time employment in both complete and non-remittance loan status and part-time has the least correlation with the loan status.

> The relationship between occuption and loan status shows that other occupation is more related with the loan status than other stated occupation. Next in line is the professional occupation while the student-technical school is the list.

> The relationship between listing category and loan status shows that the debt consolidation has the best relationship with loan status than any other category. It can also be observe that RV, green loans, and not available categories have no relationship with loan status.

> There is a positive and significant relationship between the debt consolidation, loan original amount, and completed loan status.

> Between income range, loan status and loan original amount, It can be indicated that income range of 100,000 + dollars has the highest completed and non-remittance loan status as well as the loan original amount. It shows that as the income range increases the loan status increases. It can also be observed that income range between 1-24,999 dollars has the lowest loan status and loan original amount.
